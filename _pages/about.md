Currently, I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the Dept. ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working with Prof. [Khaled B. Letaief](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=khaled-ben-letaief-eekhaled).

Prior to this, I have received the Ph.D. degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (ShanghaiTech University), Shanghai, China, in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Yong Zhou](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/zhouyong/index.html), and the B.Sc. degree from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018.
During Nov. 2022 to Oct. 2023, I was a visiting doctoral researcher in CWC, Oulu university, supervised by Prof. [Mehdi Bennis](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-mehdi-bennis/home).

My research areas include **edge AI, radio resource management, and distributed AI in B5G/6G**.


<!-- My research is primarily centered around the utilization of Generative AI in Intelligent networks. Our key objective is to explore "how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services", and "how generative AI can improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability". This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies: -->

<!-- AI for Communication:
1. Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
2. Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems

Communication for AI:
1. Distributed training and inference of large AI models
2. Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
Edge intelligence -->
