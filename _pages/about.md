I'm a post-doctoral research fellow in the Dept. ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Clearwater bay, Hong Kong, working with Prof. [Khaled B. Letaief](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=khaled-ben-letaief-eekhaled).
Prior to this, I have received the B.Sc. degree from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018, and received the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China, in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Yong Zhou](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/zhouyong/index.html).
During Nov. 2022 to Oct. 2023, I was a visiting doctoral researcher in CWC, Oulu university, supervised by Prof. [Mehdi Bennis](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-mehdi-bennis/home).
My research areas include optimization, machine learning, wireless communications, and their applications to edge AI, radio resource management, and distributed AI in B5G/6G.


My research is primarily centered around the utilization of Generative AI in Intelligent networks. Our key objective is to explore "how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services", and "how generative AI can improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability". This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies:

AI for Communication:
1. Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
2. Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
3. Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

Communication for AI:
1. Distributed training and inference of large AI models
2. Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
Edge intelligence
