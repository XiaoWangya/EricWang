My research is primarily centered around the utilization of Generative AI in Intelligent networks. Our key objective is to explore "how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services", and "how generative AI can improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability". This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies:

AI for Communication:
Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
AI-enabled semantic communications
Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

Communication for AI:
Distributed training and inference of large AI models
Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
Edge intelligence
